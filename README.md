Description coming soon

Connections (RPi 0W): VCC = 5V, GND = 0V, TRIG = GPIO18, ECHO = GPIO6, SCL = GPIO5, SDA = GPIO3

# TODO

* Setup development environment, hardware and Pi (make schematic?)
* Program to trigger sensor with PWM (Josh, DONE)
* Program to input readings from sensor (Siddhartha)
* Program to process readings, output avg. distance, mean, std (both)
* Code to drive I2C display, use external library?
* Move makefile out of src, header files to /inc
* 3D print case? If so, ask Amir for help
